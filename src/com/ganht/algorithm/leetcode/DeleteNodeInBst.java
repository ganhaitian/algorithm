/**
 * Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST.
 * Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.
 * <p>
 * Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:
 * <p>
 * Search for a node to remove.
 * If the node is found, delete the node.
 * Note: Time complexity should be O(height of tree).
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * <p>
 * root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
 * key = 3
 * <p>
 * 5
 * / \
 * 3   6
 * / \   \
 * 2   4   7
 * <p>
 * Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
 * <p>
 * One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the following BST.
 * <p>
 * 5
 * / \
 * 4   6
 * /     \
 * 2       7
 * <p>
 * Another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7].
 * <p>
 * 5
 * / \
 * 2   6
 * \   \
 * 4   7
